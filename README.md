## How It Works
1. **Upload Your Handwriting**:  
   Users upload an image containing handwritten text. The application extracts contours and converts the style into a font-like structure.

2. **Render Custom Text**:  
   Users can type text to see it displayed in either the uploaded handwriting style or a default handwriting style.

3. **SVG Path Generation**:  
   The handwriting paths are processed into SVGs for scalable, high-quality rendering.
